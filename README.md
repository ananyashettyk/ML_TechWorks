Approach :
- Collecting the data and understanding the dataset.  
- Data Preprocessing • Handle missing values  • Convert categorical variables to numeric 
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  Analyze the dataset to identify patterns, correlations, and outliers with isualizations. 
- Feature selection of variables.  
- Choose several regression models to train and evaluate, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests. 
- Split the data into training and testing sets. Train the models and evaluate their performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
- Fine-tune the best performance model by adjesting hyperparameters to enhance it's predictive accuracy.

There are several regression models to train and evaluate, like 'Linear Regression', 'Ridge Regression', 'Lasso Regression', 'Decision Tree', 'Random Forest', 'Gradient Boosting'.
